# General
[Outlyer Analysis](https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783319475776#aboutBook)
- Good reference book witch covers numerous anomaly detection approaches. 

# Kernel Density Estimation
[Nonparametric Statistics](https://bookdown.org/egarpor/NP-UC3M/)
- Online book the cover the theory behind kernel density estimation and related nonparametric methods.

[MoM-KDE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16590.pdf)
- Paper for the median-of-means kde.

[RDKE](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume13/kim12b/kim12b.pdf)
- Paper on robust kernel density estimation via M-estimation in the RKHS.

[SPKDE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4378.pdf)

- Recent successes in anomaly detection through modern deep learning methods such as generative adversarial 
  networks have attracted much attention lately.
- This article provides a sound and relatively up-to-date review over the available methods.
