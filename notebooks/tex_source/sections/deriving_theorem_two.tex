Use the approximation $\ln(1+x) \approx x$ for $|x| \ll 1$ and $F(z) \approx
1$ for large enough $z$ to derive.


\begin{equation}
    \label{GPD-approx-original}
    P(X-u < y \mid X > u) \approx 1 - \left( 1 + \frac{\xi \ y}{\tilde{\sigma}} \right)^{-\frac{1}{\xi}} 
\end{equation}


for large enough $u$ (this is a slightly less formal derivation of Pickands' et.
al. theorem). One could equivalently write


\begin{equation}
    P(X-u > y \mid X > u) \approx \left( 1 + \frac{\xi \ y}{\tilde{\sigma}} \right)^{-\frac{1}{\xi}}.
\end{equation}


What is the relation between $\tilde{\sigma}$ and the normalizing coefficients
of the first theorem of EVT?
